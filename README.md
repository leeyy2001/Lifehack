WELCOME TO TECHBIOS'S TELEGRAM BOT

**How does the bot work on telegram ?**

Our project provides a telegram bot that will help link up volunteers with volunteer organisations. This is done by finding out whether a user is a prospective volunteer and their location in Singapore such that they get choices of places to volunteer near their home. Then it provides a list of all the different volunteering organisation in that region with links to their website and their exact addresses for the user to have easy access to more information.
