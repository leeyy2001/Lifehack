WELCOME TO TECHBIOS'S TELEGRAM BOT

**How does the bot work on telegram ?**

Our project provides a telegram bot that will help link up volunteers with volunteer organisations. This is done by finding out whether a user is a prospective volunteer and their location in Singapore such that they get choices of places to volunteer near their home. Then it provides a list of all the different volunteering organisation in that region with links to their website and their exact addresses for the user to have easy access to more information.

**Commands**

/start is to start the programme
/reachOut is to get help and provides the email of the team members such that anyone with queries regarding the bot and it’s functionality are able to easily reach out to the team
/talking lets the bot know that you are interested to volunteer and want to find out about volunteering organisations near your location
The bot then takes inputs such as N for North or C for Central such that it’s able to best provide a volunteering organisation that would fit the users needs

**Libraries Used**

python-telegram-bot - to receive inputs from Telegram and export outputs onto Telegram
